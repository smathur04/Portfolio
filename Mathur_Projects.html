            This project's objective was to make a creative spin-off based on a 
            prewritten tutorial on MIT App Inventor. My partner and I chose to use 
            the <a href=http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/minigolf.html>Mini Golf Tutorial</a>
            and add a whole lot of new features and improvements to make it our own. MIT App
            Inventor is a program similar to Scratch for coding android apps, execept it is 
            more difficult and slightly buggy. Neverthless, as a team we overcame
            these bugs and glitches, and ended up with a well designed Mini-Golf
            Game that came complete with bunkers, trees, and rustic graphics. Along
            with building the actual game, we had to leave comments on every chunk of
            code and had to keep full documentation on an 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11knnkowQIJeUswgWkQ0cLiEWd7Vwzr3BBLPUkwmOc_o/edit?usp=sharing">online design notebook</a>
            This documentation includes brainstorms, feedback from other groups, our
            game's beta versions, and individual daily logs. In this group project 
            I had the role as the designated leader. I was to make sure that work 
            was delegated fairly between us, that we stayed on task, and I was
            the keeper of all documents. To be a succesful leader I had to be
            patient, fair, confident, and responsible, all of which I did well at.
            Also, this project taught me a lot about how coding and sensing works
            on tablets/phones and it helped me improve my design skills.
