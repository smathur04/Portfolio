              This project's objective was to create a simple, effective, and fun way to learn about stock trading in a simulation/game type environment. 
              The code flows smoothly and is very simple to understand with all the on screen descriptions that are used to teach the concepts to the user. 
              We met all of our planned expectations and were able to add some unique features as well. We met all our requirements, including the deadline, 
              constraints, and content requirements 
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Gr-7QzHhrQxf5n_F1EWwlOg42NTyBD2Gov7F2RzN3o/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">(documentation).</a>  
              . Our code functions well, is commented, and is easy to understand. We decided from the very
              beginning that we would need to remain organized and responsible to successfully complete this project. That is why I clearly broke up the 
              work that each individual member had to do and maintained excellent communication. Whenever work needed to be switched or changed the whole group 
              was updated and involved. I was the group leader and was first to code the skeleton for the game. Afterwards, we switched who wrote the code day 
              by day, with each person pushing to GitHub when they were done. As we neared the end of the development cycle our game had already taken shape. 
              We did group bug testing while on group calls and spent hours refining and finalizing the project. While testing our project, we had to re-organize 
              the code many times in order to make it easier to understand, and to also debug parts that weren’t functioning as expected. In the end, 
              we were able to make a game that was easy to understand, and accomplished exactly what we were trying to do.

                What’s For Homework is a data gathering tool that automatically uses an algorithm to scrape data from teacher websites and google classroom to centralize a location for students to find out what homework they have for the day. Students log into a login page connected with Gmail and will be prompted to complete a one-time setup/account registration which would involve them listing their classes and respectively inputting their teacher website and/or their link to Google Classroom. Once done on initiation, the program will forever associate that student’s login with their setup schedule. Now, every time the student signs in What’s For Homework scrapes the data from the websites and lists them in an agenda for the day, creating a pre-organized agenda for the student which saves them time and effort. Along with its time-saving benefits, it will also prevent students from unnecessarily forgetting to do or turn in work. I used my extensive knowledge of Python, HTML, CSS, and libraries like Flask and Beautiful Soup to deliver a stunning website prototype that excellently displayed the possibilities and future of this product. I was the group leader and worked mainly on the code and presentation, spending countless hours trying to figure out the most feasible way to showcase the ideas of our group. I studied the arts of web scraping and web site building using Python’s libraries along with HTML and worked with my partner well to create an excellent final product.

                This project's objective was to pick a client who has specific requests
                for manipulations that they want done to several images, and to use Python to code a 
                program that meets all their criteria and requests for how and what manipulations they want done.
                My partner and I chose Client #1
                <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/13i4q6N4YVle769oGIKe2OoJI9Hs_09Ou-m2SL3P6XK0/edit?usp=sharing target="_blank">(see Client #1's criteria)</a>
                and we used our knowledge of Python and its imaging libraries to code
                a human-interactive program that can perform manipulations such
                as backgrounds, borders, logos, and more all while allowing the user to choose
                how they want things to be done. We also had to keep strict documentation,
                which you can access
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TU6uMybzeDiYIBYQa_Xm4_M6mKBL6jAxfL9ZjwtbNkE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a>
                For this project, I was the designated
                group leader and was in charge of most of the coding, planning, and 
                organization. My partner provided lots of help with brainstorming and documentation, and we worked well as a group.
                Through this project, I learned that sometimes it is better to make simpler things
                that work perfectly, rather than to get ahead of yourself and make awesome things that work poorly.
                I saw many people try to code things very advanced that did not work out well and ended up costing
                them a lot. That's why I chose to focus on coding things I knew were moderately advanced, but still 
                achievable within my timeframe. That way, I was able to make sure that every feature I implemented was
                perfect and contained no missing links. While working on this, we faced several bumps in the road, but
                as group leader I helped us get through them with as little trouble as possible. There were many times
                when code was not working and we were struggling, but I solved this by getting organized, getting help
                from others, or changing directions and working on another aspect of the project. Also, as leader 
                I made sure to let my partner get a say in every decision that we made and I made sure we kept
                constant communication.

                This project's objective was to design and build a scale prototype for the members of a compound that solves a stated problem
                that we got to come up with. Our problem statement was the following: People who use playground slides are almost always subject to 
                walking back up to the top to use the slide again and are also subject to boring and generic playground slides. 
                This ultimately makes the playground slide much more boring and tiresome as it isn’t able to meet the standards of people in this day and age.
                We also had to keep strict documentation, which you can access
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5_IXSHvD91mlepQ0MPubp3TxC6e8RE3cDmr6WZ1QF4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a>
                For this project, I was the group leader along with being a builder and helping on documentation. I specifically built the
                inclined plane and pulley system and on the documentation I helped with overall neatness, the design brief, and the design proposal.
                I faced several challenges while building: stripped screws, incorrect placements of parts, and bad planning. However,
                I did not let these obstacles get in my way and I worked overtime to get my work done. Additionally, as group leader I 
                made sure communication was common and appropriate along with making sure everybody pulled their own weight, including myself.

                This project's objective was to design, create and test prototypes that used 
                different configurations of solar cells and hydrogen fuel cells as power sources. 
                Then, using those prototypes we gathered information about different energy source 
                combinations to recommend for optimal power generation. We did this because 
                the gas we use to fuel cars is causing too much pollution, costs too much money, 
                and is a non-renewable resource that we must preserve for as long as possible. Additionally,
                we were constrained to using a breadboard, wiring, vex-parts, and the rest of the items specified
                on <a href="https://imgur.com/a/moa1q94" target="_blank">our equipment list.</a> 
                We also kept very strict <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iHuIxsCZne3G0pU8GcL8Pi-R5lRn21YZcF5_rchrjk8/edit#gid=1559299122" target="_blank">logs</a>

                throughout our design process. For this project, I was the group leader and I managed communication among all team members.
                I created our team group chat where we all discussed our work on a daily basis, and I made sure everybody was contributing their
                fair share to the project. My other jobs consisted of building the first model of the car, recording data while testing,
                staying after class to fix mechanical issues, and typing up the design brief.
