            This project's objective was to make a creative spin-off based on a 
            prewritten tutorial on MIT App Inventor. My partner and I chose to use 
            the <a href=http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/minigolf.html>Mini Golf Tutorial</a>
            and add a whole lot of new features and improvements to make it our own. MIT App
            Inventor is basically Scratch for coding android apps, execeptit is 
            more difficult and sslightly buggy. Neverthless, as a team we overcame
            these bugs and glitches, and ended up with a well designed Mini-Golf
            Game that came complete with bunkers, trees, and rustic graphics. Along
            with building the actual game, we had to leave comments on every chunk of
            code and had to keep full documentation on an 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11knnkowQIJeUswgWkQ0cLiEWd7Vwzr3BBLPUkwmOc_o/edit?usp=sharing">online design notebook</a>
            This documentation includes brainstorms, feedback from other groups, our
            game's beta versions, and individual daily logs. In this group project 
            I had the role as the designated leader. I was to make sure that work 
            was delegated fairly between us, that we stayed on task, and I was
            the keeper of all documents. To be a succesful leader I had to be
            patient, fair, confident, and responsible, all of which I did well at.
            Also, this project taught me a lot about how coding and sensing works
            on tablets/phones and it helped me improve my design skills.

            This project's objective was to create a game or multi-plot story from
            a blank slate on Scratch. This was also a partner project, and we chose
            to make a game. At first, we had a tough time coming up with a fun,
            unique game that we could create, within our small time-frame. However, we 
            got past this by rainstorming, and we ultimately chose to make a platormer
            because we felt it would be challenging, but still achieveable for our
            first Computer Science Project. Just like in the App Inventor Project,
            we had to leave comments on every chunk of code and had to keep full documentation
            on our
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pfSjvIGzIOH-i-1XT0CqaTz1-ksS0-C-Rhsd6UQs804/edit?usp=sharing">online design notebook</a>
            This documentation also includes brainstorms, feedback from other groups, our
            game's beta versions, and individual daily logs. My role in this project
            was group leader and superviser. Similar to the other project, I diveded
            up work, turned in/was owner of all the documents, and took inititiative.
            To be a good leader for this project, I had to be a good listener, knowledgeable,
            and I had to be able to make the right decision. This project taught me
            the more advanced side of scratch, it helped me improve my leadership skills,
            and made me learn how to properly document all my work.
