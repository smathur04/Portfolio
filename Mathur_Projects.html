              This project's objective was to make a creative spin-off based on a 
              prewritten tutorial on MIT App Inventor. My partner and I chose to use 
              the <a href=http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/minigolf.html>Mini Golf Tutorial</a>
              and add a whole lot of new features and improvements to make it our own. MIT App
              Inventor is a program similar to Scratch for coding android apps, execept it is 
              more difficult and slightly buggy. Neverthless, as a team we overcame
              these bugs and glitches, and ended up with a well designed Mini-Golf
              Game that came complete with bunkers, trees, and rustic graphics. Along
              with building the actual game, we had to leave comments on every chunk of
              code and had to keep full documentation on an 
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11knnkowQIJeUswgWkQ0cLiEWd7Vwzr3BBLPUkwmOc_o/edit?usp=sharing">online design notebook</a>
              This documentation includes brainstorms, feedback from other groups, our
              game's beta versions, and individual daily logs. In this group project 
              I had the role as the designated leader. I was to make sure that work 
              was delegated fairly between us, that we stayed on task, and I was
              the keeper of all documents. To be a succesful leader I had to be
              patient, fair, confident, and responsible, all of which I did well at.
              Also, this project taught me a lot about how coding and sensing works
              on tablets/phones and it helped me improve my design skills.

              This project's objective was to pick a client who has specific requests
              for manipulatons that they want done to several images, and to use Python to code a 
              program that meets all their criteria and requests for how and what manipulatons they want done.
              My partner and I chose Client #1
              <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/13i4q6N4YVle769oGIKe2OoJI9Hs_09Ou-m2SL3P6XK0/edit?usp=sharing>(see Client #1's criteria)</a>
              and we used our knowledge of Python and its imaging libraries to code
              a human-interactive program that can preform manipulations such
              as backgrounds, borders, logos, and more all while allowing the user to choose
              how they want things to be done. We also had to keep strict documentation,
              which you can access
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TU6uMybzeDiYIBYQa_Xm4_M6mKBL6jAxfL9ZjwtbNkE/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>
              For this project, I was the designated
              group leader and was in charge of most of the coding, planning, and 
              organization. My partner provided lots of help with brainstorming and documentation, and we worked well as a group.
              Through this project, I learned that sometimes it is better to make simpler things
              that work perfectly, rather than to get ahead of yourself and make awesome things that work poorly.
              I saw many people try to code things very advanced that did not work out well and ended up costing
              them a lot. That's why I chose to focus on coding things I knew were moderately advanced, but still 
              achievable within my timeframe. That way, I was able to make sure that every feature I implemented was
              perfect and contained no missing links. While working on this, we faced several bumps in the road, but
              as group leader I helped us get through them with as little trouble as possible. There were many times
              when code was not working and we were struggling, but I solved this by getting organized, getting help
              from others, or changing directions and working on another aspect of the project. Also, as leader 
              I made sure to let my partner get a say in every decision that we made and I made sure we kept
              constant communication.
