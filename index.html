            I have been playing Golf for 5 years, from
            2013 to now. I started playing back in the 4th Grade when my dad 
            first took me to the driving range. After the first day I tried it,
            I was hooked and loved the sport. I currently play tournaments such
            as JGANC, US Kids, and JTNC. However, I have the most fun when I play
            a round with my dad. Our entire weekend goes to playing golf, and I try
            to lower my score every week. Some of my lowest scores are 77 and 79, but
            my main goal right now is to reach a single digit handicap. In other words,
            I want to start to consitently shoot in the 70's. My favorite course to play 
            at are Redwood Canyon and San Ramon.

            This project was done in my Computer Science Principles class during 
            my freshman year (2018-2019). For this project me and one partner
            had to pick an app tutorial on MIT App Inventor and edit it to make
            it our own. Not only did we have to use App Inventor to improve and 
            edit our selected tutorial, but we also had to comment on all of our
            code, keep neat documentation, and record a daily log.

          <p class="card-title">
            I have been doing Speech and Debate for 3 years and I usually do it 
            during the summer in the Monte Vista Speech and Debate Program. In that
            program we can choose up to two different events and the take classes
            about them for two weeks. After the two weeks we have a massive
            tournament for every event and then there is a burger afterwards.
            I usually took a debate event and always took Interpretation. For
            the tournament I always competed in Interpretation. My first year
            doing it (2016) I competed against older and more experienced kids but 
            still won first place. The year after that (2017) I won 1st place again
            and I look foreward to competing more next year!
