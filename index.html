                    My name is Shaan Mathur and I am a junior at Dublin High School. I have a 4.50 weighted grade point average and a 1510 SAT score. I don't shy away from challenge or failure, and I live by the philosophy that everyday should be slightly better than the last. I am a part of the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy, through which I have specialized in advanced computer science courses, completed several projects, been on STEM based field trips, and gained useful and relevant skills (including coding this website!). My experience with this academy and my specific STEM skills will be expanded more on this website and in my resume.

                    I am also an extremely competitive golfer and powerlifter. Next year I will be a captain for the varsity boys golf team at my highschool and this summer I am attempting to break several California state powerlifting records. The commitment I have made to my athletics is outstanding and I spend hours on a daily basis pushing myself to reach my goals. Furthermore, I am a long term member of the California Scholarship Federation and a mentor to twenty four freshmen who I hold group sessions with to ensure their experience in high school is top notch.

                    My main career objective is to become a nuclear scientist or artificial intelligence engineer for a large company or organization and eventually create a successful start-up. A few short term goals I have set to achieve this goal are to publish a research paper on a subset of artificial intelligence and to find an internship in the STEM field where I can broaden my view of the working world and diversify my interests.

                    I am a first generation immigrant. I was born in India and moved to the United States as a five year old, leaving behind everything I knew and had grown up with. I have moved from state to state and city to city, each time having to delve into new communities, environments, and lifestyles. This made me adaptable and versatile, I do not fall victim to discomfort and I know how to work through new challenges. I have grown up my whole life dealing with financial and immigration related problems. I have had to deal with so many missed opportunities and freedoms due to variables that were out of my control. But this has only made me tougher and made me value whatever I do have available to me. On a side note, I am working on a campaign to spread awareness for H4 visa employment authorization document delays and how it has negatively impacted thousands of skilled immigrant workers, I will be updating my portfolio with more information on this soon! In addition, my diverse athletic background has taught me that there is nothing more valuable than hard work and discipline. Lastly, I am a well rounded leader and a team player. I am confident when speaking to new teammates whether they are more skilled or less skilled than me. I see each individual as a valuable piece of the team and I am as much a listener as I am a speaker. A great example of this comes directly from my courses in the Engineering Academy. There are many team projects where I was paired with those who had more prior knowledge than me, yet they looked to me as the group leader. This is because I knew how to take a bunch of individuals and bring the best out of them to create a team that cultivated creativity and success.

                    As mentioned earlier, I have a passion for academic excellence. I take the most difficult courses I can in highschool, but not because I want the grade bump, but rather because I love to learn. When I discover something I am passionate about, my brain becomes a sponge for any and all information I can find. I am fully committed to whatever I enjoy doing, and as of right now I really enjoy exploring coding, artificial intelligence, and nuclear fusion. My enjoyment of learning has allowed me to achieve a 4.5 gpa and a 99th percentile SAT score. I have excellent proficiency in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and I am working on taking courses to branch my Python skills into the world of artificial intelligence.
