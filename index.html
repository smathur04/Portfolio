              I have been playing Golf for 5 years, from
              2013 to now. I started playing back in the 4th Grade when my dad 
              first took me to the driving range. After the first day I tried it,
              I was hooked and loved the sport. I currently play tournaments such
              as JGANC, US Kids, and JTNC. However, I have the most fun when I play
              a round with my dad. Our entire weekend goes to playing golf, and I try
              to lower my score every week. Some of my lowest scores are 77 and 79, but
              my main goal right now is to reach a single digit handicap. In other words,
              I want to start to consitently shoot in the 70's. My favorite course to play 
              at are Redwood Canyon and San Ramon.

            This project was done in my Computer Science Principles class during

            had to pick an app tutorial on MIT App Inventor and edit it to make
            it our own. Not only did we have to use App Inventor to improve and 
            edit our selected tutorial, but we also had to comment on all of our
            code, keep neat documentation, and record a daily log.

            <h5 class="card-title">
              I have been doing Speech and Debate for 3 years and I usually do it 
              during the summer in the Monte Vista Speech and Debate Program. In that
              program we can choose up to two different events and the take classes
              about them for two weeks. After the two weeks we have a massive
              tournament for every event and then there is a burger afterwards.
              I usually took a debate event and always took Interpretation. For
              the tournament I always competed in Interpretation. My first year
              doing it (2016) I competed against older and more experienced kids but 
              still won first place. The year after that (2017) won 1st place again 
              and I look foreward to competing more next year.
