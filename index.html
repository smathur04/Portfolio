            <h6 style="text-indent: 40px">My name is Shaan Mathur and I currently
            am a sophomore at Dublin High School. Outside of school, I am a competitive
            golfer, studying machine learning, and a powerlifter. A few of my current short term goals are to lower 
            my handicap to single digits, to get quicker/more proficient at coding,
            and to enjoy high school as much as possible. My main 
            career goal is to create my own machine learning or artificial intelligence related business after college.
            To achieve this massive goal I plan to learn coding
            and engineering, and then expand more into finance. Both of my parents are
            in finance and I have always found it fascinating so I would love to 
            couple that with technology and have my own business.</h6>
            
            <h6 style="text-indent: 40px">I was born in India but moved to Memphis,
            Tennessee at the age of four. I lived there for 2 years and then moved 
            to Glendale, Arizona for another 2 years. After that, I stayed in New 
            Jersey for a few months and then finally came to California. All of this
            travelling helped me develop great social skills and taught me how to 
            make friends as I was always "the new kid at school". I also am very
            diplomatic due my years of speech and debate experience. If I am working 
            with others, rather than argue, I try to sort things out fairly and calmly. 
            These qualities make me a natural leader who is responsible and reliable. 
            In addition, playing golf for several years has taught me to be a honest 
            and sincere person that does not lie or try to deceive anyone. Additionally,
            this year I have been doing a lot of group projects in my Honors Principles of Engineering 
            class like the Mechanical Winch Project or Project Compound and I am almost always group leader.</h6>
            
            <h6 style="text-indent: 40px">A few of my best academic achievements are getting 
            all A's every quarter throughout all of middle school and so far throughout high school, even in classes like Honors Principles of Engineering, AP European Histroy, and Honors Chemistry. Outside of school, my best 
            Golf related achievements are getting 4th in a JGANC tournament and US Kids tournament, shooting 
            79 at Redwood Canyon Golf Course, and shooting 77 at Las Positas Golf Course.
            Also, I have won 1st place for the Interpretation event twice at Monte Vista
            High School. Some more info about me is that I am an 
            only child and I have a Labrador mix named Blaze (who I absolutely adore).
            Also, I love to travel, eat great food, and hang out with my friends
            and family. I hope you enjoyed learning about me and feel free to check
            out the rest of my website to see more of my work, achievements, and 
            aspirations!
