              I have been playing Golf for 7 years, from 2013 to now. I started 
              playing back in the 4th Grade when my dad first took me to the 
              driving range. After my first time trying it, I was hooked and have
              loved the sport ever since. I currently play in tournaments such as 
              JGANC and JTNC. I have placed fourth in both a US Kids and 
              JTNC tournament, both with a field of over 25 kids. However, I have the 
              most fun when I play rounds with my dad. Our entire weekend goes to
              playing golf, and I try to lower my scores every week. Additionally,
              I made my highschool's Varsity Boy's Golf Team as a Freshman and as a Sophomore and 
              played great throughout each season. Currently, some of my lowest 
              scores are 77 and 79, but my goal is to reach a single digit 
              handicap. In other words, I want to start to consistently shoot in 
              the 70's. Also, right before the shelter in place orders I tied for
              second at a touranment where our school competed against many other
              schools. My favorite courses to play at are Callipe and The Bridges, 
              and I hope to continue to play long after I have 
              graduated (hopefully in College too!).

            <p class="card-title">
              In my Freshman year (2018-2019) of highschool, I took the Computer 
              Science Principles elective. Prior to this, I had little to no 
              knowledge about this subject, but after taking it, I discovered
              that I truly have a passion for coding and I find it interesting.
              Additionally, I applied to join the Dublin High School Engineering
              Academy under the computer science pathway and I got accepted. The
              Computer Science Principles elective taught me Javascript, HTML,
              CSS, Python, Command Line, SQL, and GIT. Also, we learned how the
              internet works, binary, and internet security. Then, in my Sophomore
              year (2019-2020) I took a course called Honors Principles of Engineering which
              furthered my knowledge about the fundamentals of mechanical and
              electral engineering and allowed me to see how different fields of
              engineering all work hand in hand. This year, as a Junior (2020-2021) I am taking
              AP Computer Science Applications which is an advanced, Java based coding
              course.

            <p class="card-title"> 
              I have been powerlifting for two years now and I plan to compete
              as soon as powerlifting meets start opening up again. My goal
              is to beat the California state bench press record for my age
              and weight class. To achieve such a huge goal I have spent hours
              of my own time researching nutrition, supplementation, training,
              and the science behind strength training. I workout six days a week
              and I am very comitted to powerlifting. Going to the gym is a passion
              of mine and I see it as something I will continue to do for the rest of my life.
