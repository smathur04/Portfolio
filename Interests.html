              I have been playing Golf for 5 years, from 2013 to now. I started 
              playing back in the 4th Grade when my dad first took me to the 
              driving range. After my first time trying it, I was hooked and have
              loved the sport ever since. I currently play in tournaments such as 
              JGANC, US Kids, and JTNC. I have even placed fourth in a US Kids and 
              JTNC game, both with a field of over 25 kids. However, I have the 
              most fun when I play rounds with my dad. Our entire weekend goes to
              playing golf, and I try to lower my scores every week. Additionally,
              I made my highschool's Varsity Boy's Golf Team as a Freshman and 
              played great throughout the season. Currently, some of my lowest 
              scores are 77 and 79, but my goal is to reach a single digit 
              handicap. In other words, I want to start to consistently shoot in 
              the 70's. My favorite courses to play at are Redwood Canyon and San 
              Ramon, and I hope to continue to play long after I have 
              graduated (hopefully in College too!).

            <p class="card-title">
              In my Freshman year (2018-2019) of highschool, I took the Computer 
              Science Principles elective. Prior to this, I had little to no 
              knowledge about this subject, but after taking it, I have discovered
              that I truly have a passion for coding and I find it interesting.
              Additionally, I applied to join the Dublin High School Engineering
              Academy under the computer science pathway and I got accepted. The
              Computer Science Principles elective has taught me Javascript, HTML,
              CSS, Python, Command Line, SQL, and GIT. Also, we learned how the
              internet works, binary, and internet security.

            <p class="card-title">
              I have been doing Speech and Debate for 3 years and I usually do it 
              during the summer in the Monte Vista Speech and Debate Program. In 
              that program we can choose up to two different events and the take 
              classes about them for two weeks. After the two weeks we have a 
              massive tournament for every event and then have an award ceremony.
              I always take one debate event and (my favorite) Interpretation. 
              For the tournament, I always compete in Interpretation. My first 
              year doing it (2016) I competed against older and more experienced 
              kids but still won first place. The year after that (2017) I won 1st
              place again and I look forward to competing more next year!
