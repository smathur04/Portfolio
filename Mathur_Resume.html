            <h4 style="text-indent: 40px">
            During my time in the engineering program, I have met a
            number of industry professionals through workplace field trips 
            and guest speakers. By meeting these highly experienced and
            influential people I have learned a lot about different
            career paths, fields of study, and disciplines of engineering.
            So far, I have met a nuclear engineer, a machine learning engineer,
            geo-tech engineers, a civil engineer, aerospace engineers, and many
            biotech engineers.

            So far, my most influential and memorable field trip was my trip to 
            Roche where I explored biotech engineering, engineering applications 
            with medicine, how buisnesses are started, and even how to negotiate 
            a deal. This field trip had a unique way of showing us around and 
            introducing us to new concepts. By splitting up into groups we got 
            to meet different people from different positions in the company. 
            I got to meet people who worked on the financial and management side, 
            people who worked directly with machinery, and even people who actually 
            work in labs with viruses and medicine. While our group was with the 
            management and financial workers at Roche they made us do a negotiation 
            activity where I got to be one of the two lead negotiatiors. I 
            immediately took lead and solved the negotiation within a record 
            time. This really spiked my interests in finance and communications
            and introduced me to a cool new career path. Also, as we toured the 
            building and labs I learned a lot about the very complicated machines 
            and technology in use which had helped solve tough problems and make 
            jobs more efficient. Overall, this field trip broadened my view of 
            engineering jobs and helped me see how my skills might influence 
            the jobs I get in the future.

            The guest speaker who I learned the most from and was most influenced by was 
            Maynard Holliday, who worked for Barack Obama during his presidency and combined 
            nuclear, electrical, and mechanical engineering to create a robot which worked in
            Cherynobl after the meltdown. Before meeting Mr.Holliday we learned about nuclear 
            chemistry in our Honors Chemistry class and I was incredibly interested in it. That 
            is why I thoroughly enjoyed Mr.Holliday's lecture and story. He expalained the terrible
            meltdown that occured in Cherynobl in great detail and I understood everything he was 
            saying. I have always had my interests spread in multiple different fields so seeing 
            how Mr.Holliday worked with so many different engineering disciplines and combined 
            them in such a unique way inspired me. His job was exactly the type I would like to
            have when I graduate college, incredibly hands-on and never boring.
